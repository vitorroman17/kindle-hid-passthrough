# Bundled kernel modules

Some Broadcom-era Kindles ship a kernel with `CONFIG_UHID` disabled and no
`/dev/uhid`. For those we bundle a prebuilt `uhid.ko` and `insmod` it at startup.
MediaTek Kindles (11th gen onward) have UHID in-kernel and need nothing.

Those same kernels usually disable `CONFIG_INPUT_UINPUT` as well, so we bundle
`uinput.ko` too. It is optional. The passthrough never opens `/dev/uinput`, it
only matters to external tools such as kindle-button-mapper that inject key
events, so a missing `uinput.ko` is a warning while a missing `uhid.ko` leaves
HID unusable.

Modules are matched by exact filename:
`{uhid,uinput}-{uname-r}-{trailing-build-from-/etc/version.txt}-{codename}.ko`.
A single model can need more than one module across firmware updates (different
`uname-r` or build). See `../../docs/uhid-research.md` for the build recipe.

`build` is the trailing number from `/etc/version.txt`. Kernel and build can vary
across firmware updates, so a covered model may still hit an unbuilt build. When a
Kindle hits a missing module the daemon logs the exact `.ko` filename plus its
model, codename, kernel, and `/etc/version.txt`, which is everything needed to
build it.

A module's ABI keys on `uname -r`, not the version.txt build in its filename, so
when the exact build isn't bundled the daemon tries other builds of the same
kernel and codename and lets `insmod`'s own version check decide. A firmware bump
that keeps the kernel ABI loads on an existing module; only a real `module_layout`
change forces a fresh build.
